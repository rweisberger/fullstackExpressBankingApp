<p> This is a complete MERN stack application, with CRUD capabilities. The Express application is serving the React frontend in the public directory and is connected to a Mongo Atlas cluster. The application allows users to create a bank account, login, make withdraws and deposits, view transaction history, and delete the account. Users with admin status can also view all the users information.</p>
